<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>The data for this research project is acquired through the gtrends
function from the gtrendsR package in R. This function can find the
number of a keyword proportion to all searches on all topics at the same
time. It can also provide the proportion of the searches on each keyword
with each country and cities over the specified time period. It will
also provide similar keywords to the searched keywords for number of
hits. Due to the limitation of the function, it can at most take in 5
keywords each time which means it will generate a different data set.
Hence, several keywords will need to be formed with different function
calls and we will need to store them as different variables. For each
event, we will use 5 keywords that can represent the sport event and use
the other top 10 related queries from the results of the keywords.</p>
<p>Since we are comparing over 5 different major sports events, the data
set will be combined together after extracting the information from the
results of the function call. As our main research question is comparing
these sports events within 2022, we will limit our searches to only
search queries data that occurred in 2022. We will generate with date
restrictions to our search trends for the whole 2022 year (2022-01-01 to
2022-12-31). Note that in each result of the function call, it will have
4 data frames in total where each of them are search hit over time,
country, city and major designated market area (DMA) worldwide.</p>
<p>Note that since Google trends does not store information for
locations that have extremely low search hits, the results from each
enquiry of Gtrends package may not always contain the same countries,
cities, and major designated market areas in each query to Google
trends.</p>
<p>The table below shows the keywords that we used for each sport
events. It has the initial 5 keywords that we started with and the
remaining 10 keywords based on the related queries.</p>

<p>From table 1 above, we can see that the related words are often
different keywords that people will search for that specific event. For
example, people will search “fifa 2022” instead of “world cup” as some
people used the organization that is holding this event. Similarly,
people will search for “winter games 2022” instead of olympics as these
are words that leads people to think of that event. For sport events,
people are curious on the rank of the leading in each sport, but in the
esports activity, other noticing keywords that appears in each event was
the prize pool for the esports championship games.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-wrangling" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Wrangling</h2>
<p>The data cleaning for each sport event will be relatively similar
because the generated results have fixed columns and information inside
are the same.We will first extract the <code>interest over time</code>
dataframe from each queries and combine them into a single dataframe.
Afterwards, we will be changing the date columns from character values
into Date by using <code>as.Date</code> in R. Next, we will place all
values in the hits column (which indicate the proportion of search on
the topic compared to all samples of all searches) that has
<code>&lt;1</code> into 0. This is to have all values that has less than
1% of search in the week to be considered as 0 as these are too small.
Finally, we will group the data by their dates and use the summarise
function to compute the mean of hits in each week with missing values
removed.</p>
<p>For the remaining 3 data frames where there are categories by
country, city, and major DMA worldwide, the numbers of hits column in
these data frames is not separated by weeks, as they are the highest
score that occurred during the search period (2022-01-01 to 2022-12-31).
We will group them by either their country, city and major DMA depending
on the data frame and compute the average of hits. We will handle the
same as previous for hits that have <code>&lt;1</code> and remove NA
values.</p>
<p>Notice that when using the gtrends function call, sometimes the type
for the number of hits are not in integer and stored as character type.
Hence, we will need to convert it to integer before merging the data
from each function call.</p>
<p>Finally, we will sort the remaining 3 data frames by the highest
search queries in their region for better demonstration of the data
frame.</p>
<p>Below are the first six rows after data cleaning for each sports of
the remaining 3 data frames:</p>

<p>From table 2, it is showing the top 6 location of search hits in
different location categories on world cup. We can see that cities that
are appearing in the top 6 are locations that has extremely low
population except Lusail which is one of the city that is in the hosting
country. In the countries categories, most of them are relatively small
countries and the hosting country does have an extremely high search
hits. For designated market area, we can see the high search hits are
location that had high population rate in the city and it an important
city for the United States.</p>

<p>From table 3 above, we can see that it follows a similar trend that
the location where the event was held has a 100 search hits, however,
due to google access limitations in China, the countries search hit is
to be lower than Mongolia. Notice that Canada has a similar search hits
result as China which is reasonable as Winter Olympics is one of the
international events that Canada usually does well. From the DMA
location, it seems that the top scores are locations in United states
that have low population and it does not follows the pattern with
previous table.</p>

<p>From table 4, we can see that the cities that have the top six are
locations that are small town all around the world. The countries that
have the top search hits produce a different results comparing to
previous as most of the countries here are big countries that are well
known. Although the event was held in Brimingham, United Kingom, the
search hits was only 40.6. For the DMA locations, we can see that some
location are big cities in United States which follows a similar trend
to previous result.</p>

<p>From table 5, cities that are having high search hits are mostly
United states cities where there is a famous college. This could due to
League of Legends is highly popular between students as this is a video
game. From the countries, it is relatively different as most countries
are in Europe and the championship events were actually hold in United
States. From the DMA section, the locations seems to varies between big
cities and small cities. It also shows a similar result with League of
Legend games but not with other sports event.</p>

small cities, which comparing to previous table, it shows differently.

<h2>Data Merging</h2>
<p>We will merge all cities data with different sport events into one
data by their city with using full join since the number of cities in
each data could be different. We will also do this to the countries data

<p>Figure 1 is the barplot shows cities that have at least 2 search hits
in the 5 sport events. I limited to at least 2 because most of the
cities have either only have 1 search hits. We can see that most of the
cities from the bar plot are considered as one of the major city in the
province. We can see that World Cup and Olympic Games has very high
search trends as it appears in all cities but commonwealth games does
not. A very surprising result was League of Legend where it appears in
most of the cities. By filtering the events, we can compares the search
hits for an isolated event. As the default is showing cities that has
two results in the sport hits, there are other cities that are not
shown.</p>

<p>Figure 2 is barplot that only shows countries that have all 5 sport
events and search queries. From the country search trend, we can see
most of the countries have at least some search trend in the World Cup
event. Some countries have relatively low search in Olympic games. For
League of Legends, we can see most of the countries have very high
search hits compared to Dota 2. We can filter out some events and only
comparing between 1 to 4 events instead of 5. It shows the sums of
search hits in total for the sport events which also can determine
whether there are some countries that have extremely high search hits in
all different sport games. For the Commonwealth Games, it seems that
some countries have more searches in the Commonwealth compared to the
Olympics but would need further investigation.</p>

<p>Figure 3 is a barplot that shows the search hits for designated
market area with all 5 sports events. It can produce a comparison
between area whether the search trends are similar and whether there is
an event is more outstanding in some areas. Also, it can tell which area
have the highest search trends among all events. However, from the
search trend plot above, we can see most events have a relatively
consistent search hits among all different games. One of the most
surprising results was that Dota 2 hits were relatively higher than
League of Legends but this trend was not found in previous barplot.</p>
